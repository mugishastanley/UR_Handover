##Prediction:
#Problem statement:
We have a hand moving in a workspace. The robot has to predict when the hand stops and then plan the motion to the hand. 
This is hand over point prediction problem.
 To do:
 Simulate hand motion: 
 Write a publisher that publishes in a 3D poses area bounded by the robot workspace.
 	The points will be incremented by a hand motion model (The minimum jerk) at a frequency of 33 Hz. (model based)
 	A GP may be used to learn the model and predict the HOP (Data driven).
 
A subscriber to the Estimated hand over point is used to plan the robot motion.
